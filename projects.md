# Projects

Here are some of the projects that I've completed and what I am currently working on:

**Identifying Fraudulent Transactions in Travel and Expense Reports (AGCO Corporation)**:

Date: January 2024 to May 2024

In collaboration with AGCO Corporation as part of my Consulting Practicum, I was tasked with identifying potential outliers in the company's travel and expense reports. During this project, I used Python to build and tune an Isolation Forest and a Principal Component Analysis model to automate anomaly detection, further enhancing each model's accuracy through continuous feedback and pattern analysis. After compiling a list of transactions that could be potential outliers, I piped the data into Tableau to create an interactive dashboard to present the main insights, allowing the audit team to quickly identify and investigate the suspicious reports.
