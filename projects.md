# Projects

Here are some of the projects that I've completed and what I am currently working on:

**Identifying Fraudulent Transactions in Travel and Expense Reports (AGCO Corporation)**:

**Date**: January 2024 to May 2024

**Software Used**: Python, Tableau, Excel

In collaboration with AGCO Corporation as part of my Consulting Practicum, I was tasked with identifying potential outliers in the company's travel and expense reports. During this project, I used Python to build and tune an Isolation Forest and a Principal Component Analysis model to automate anomaly detection, further enhancing each model's accuracy through continuous feedback and pattern analysis. After compiling a list of transactions that could be potential outliers, I piped the data into Tableau to create an interactive dashboard to present the main insights, allowing the audit team to quickly identify and investigate the suspicious reports. 


**Estimating Vaccination Rates for H1N1 and Seasonal Influenza**:

**Date**: November 2023 to December 2023

**Software Used**: Python

In this project, I used predictive modeling with the National 2009 H2N1 Flu Survey dataset to determine the individual vaccination likelihood for the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus and the seasonal influenza virus. Through careful data preprocessing that included accounting for missing values, ensuring all numeric variables were scaled properly, and encoding categorical variables in a binary representation, I ensured that the data was prepared efficiently prior to constructing the machine learning models. The models that I constructed in this project were Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classification, XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting), Decision Tree Classifier, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine). By tuning each model's hyperparameters with Grid-Search Cross-Validation, I was able to effectively minimize computational resources and maximize ROC_AUC performance.
